## Idea behind the example
This is an of how to use Razzle with [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).

Basic razzle will uses Babel to transform TypeScript to plain JavaScript ( with babel-loader ), and uses TypeScript for type-checking.

Razzle knows how to resolve `.ts` and `.tsx` files out of the box.
